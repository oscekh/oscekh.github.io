## GSoC'21 Blog - Implementing a View-Only Mode in the GnuRadio Companion (GRC)

Welcome to my blog, here I will provide weekly progress updates on my work on the GRC for Google Summer of Code.

Coding will begin on June 7th, the period before that is for community bonding and getting comfortable with the codebase to get ready for coding. This includes studying the code base, solving smaller issues and discussing with the mentors.
